### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is welcoming and highly collaborative. FCJ team members are always ready to assist whenever I run into challenges — even beyond regular working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, which helps me stay focused and productive. Still, I believe that adding more team bonding activities or informal gatherings would help everyone connect and understand each other better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**  
My mentor offers clear, thorough guidance and takes the time to explain concepts whenever I struggle to understand something. They also encourage me to ask questions and explore different approaches. The admin team is very supportive with documentation, administrative processes, and day-to-day logistics, making the internship experience seamless. I especially appreciate that my mentor allows me to experiment and solve problems independently rather than simply providing the answers.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Background**  
The tasks assigned to me align well with what I have studied in school while also exposing me to new concepts and tools that I had not encountered before. This combination helped reinforce my academic foundation and develop practical, industry-relevant skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I gained valuable experience with project management tools, strengthened my teamwork abilities, and improved my professional communication in a corporate setting. My mentor also shared practical industry insights that helped me better understand and shape my career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company fosters a very positive culture where everyone is respectful, supportive, and dedicated. Despite the serious approach to work, the atmosphere remains friendly and energetic. When urgent tasks arise, the whole team collaborates effectively, offering help regardless of roles or seniority. This made me feel truly integrated into the team, even as an intern.

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides internship allowances and accommodates flexible working hours when necessary. Moreover, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a significant advantage that greatly contributed to my professional growth.


### Additional Questions

**What were you most satisfied with during the internship?**  
I was most satisfied with the strong support from my mentor and the friendly, open working environment that helped me learn and grow quickly.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
I think it would be beneficial to introduce more mini-projects or specialized workshops so interns can gain more hands-on experience with real-world scenarios.

**Would you recommend this internship program to your friends? Why or why not?**  
Yes. Because it offers a great learning environment, supportive mentors, and opportunities to work with modern cloud technologies.


### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
I suggest adding more cross-team sharing sessions and offering multi-level training paths so interns can follow a clearer learning roadmap.

**Would you like to continue with this program in the future?**  
Yes, if given the opportunity, I would like to continue to deepen my knowledge and gain more practical experience.

**Other comments (free sharing):**  
Thank you to the FCJ team for your continuous support throughout my internship. I hope the program will keep growing and bring value to many more students in the future.
